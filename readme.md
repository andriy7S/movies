Movie Trailer Website.
1.This project is written in Python version 2.7. So in order to run it this particular version of Python need to be pre-installed.
2.The initial repository consists of three python (entertainment.center.py, fresh_tomatoes.py, media.py) and one readme.txt files. 
3.It is important that all files of the project must be located in the same folder (directory) before one’s run it.
4..html files should be associated with a web browser (preferably Google Chrome, or Chromium (in Linux)), not a text editor, otherwise the program generate and open HTML file as a text.
5.To run the script Windows user need to run IDLE (Python GUI), which will open Python Shell.
6.From the Python Shell need to open entertainment.center.py file and after it loaded to the shell run the module with F5 key (Run/Run Module).
7.The program will generate fresh_tomatoes.html file in the same directory and preferred browser will open automatically with Movie Trailer web page.
8.For Linux users need to verify that the correct version of python is installed by typing Python command in bash terminal. It should be version 2.7.
9.From terminal ones need to navigate to the corresponding directory (for example cd  /home/user/yourfolder where files are located, and after run the entertainment.center.py .
10.Unfortunately I have not run the program on Mac, but believe it is could be done similar to Linux, from bash terminal.
